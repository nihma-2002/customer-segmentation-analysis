# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting retail customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The objective is to identify high-value customers, customers at risk of churn, and opportunities for targeted retention strategies.

## 🎯 Business Objective
Businesses often struggle to understand which customers drive the most value and which are likely to churn. This project aims to:
- Identify high-value and loyal customers
- Detect early signs of customer churn
- Support data-driven marketing and retention decisions

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (aggregation, segmentation logic)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🔍 Analysis Overview
The analysis followed these key steps:
- Data cleaning and preparation of retail transaction data
- Calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics at customer level
- Quartile-based RFM scoring
- Mapping customers into business-aligned segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, and Lost Customers
- Export of segmentation outputs for downstream analytics or BI use

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Customer value is highly concentrated**: A relatively small group of customers classified as *Champions* and *Loyal Customers* contribute disproportionately higher monetary value and purchase frequency.

- **Clear early-warning signals for churn**: *At Risk* and *Lost Customers* show significantly higher recency values, indicating long periods of inactivity and the need for targeted retention strategies.

- **Retention opportunity among mid-tier segments**: *Potential Loyalists* demonstrate strong spending and repeat behavior but declining recency, making them ideal candidates for personalized offers and engagement campaigns.
